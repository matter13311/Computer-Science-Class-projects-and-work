(How to connect remotely to linux lab computers)
WHat does it mean to work there remotely? You come home,
you start your computer and you connect to linux lab.
How can you work in linux lab from home?

For windows
1. You need to get something called Putty(ssh-client) Putty program gives you the same ability as terminal in MAC
2. type command "ssh -X (then enter your username without parenthasis)@eniac.cs.hunter.cuny.edu" it's very important that the X is capital and not lower case.
3. You will most likely see warning "You've never connected to this server before, are you sure you want to connect?"
4. You'll see something like "password:" when you type, nothing will appear. The security system makes it so that when you type, you have to type your password blindly.
5. Once you'are connected pwd cd everything that we discussed so far. gedit my.cpp
